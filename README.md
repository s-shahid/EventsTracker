EventsTracker
=============
The goal is to create a simple app which displays a bunch of events, and allows the user to track certain events.

1.	When the user starts the app, he/she is prompted to enter his/her name.
2.	The app then shows a page with a list of events in and around the city. You can use the following data:

	Metallica Concert in Palace Grounds (paid entry)
	Saree Exhibition in Malleswaram Grounds (free entry)
	Wine tasting event in Links Brewery (paid entry)
	Startups Meet in Kanteerava Indoor Stadium (paid entry)
	Summer Noon Party in Kumara Park (paid entry)
	Rock and Roll nights in Sarjapur Road (paid entry)
	Barbecue Fridays in Whitefield (paid entry)
	Summer workshop in Indiranagar (free entry)
	Impressions & Expressions in MG Road (free entry)
	Italian carnival in Electronic City (free entry)

3.Each event in the list contains, a thumbnail of the event to be conducted, the name of the event and the place where 
it will be held, and if the event has a paid or a free entry. (The entry fee need not be displayed)
‚ÅÉWhen the user taps on an event he/she is shown another page with Event details, which includes an event image, event 
name, location, entry type (paid or free) and a button that allows the event to be tracked by the user.
4.The user should be able to view this list of events that he/she is tracking from any page.
5.The user should be able to remove an event from the tracking page.
6.The user should be able to view the event details from the tracking page.
7.The tracking list should be persistent i.e if the user exits the app and relaunches it, when the user enters his/her 
name, it should display the tracking list of that user.
